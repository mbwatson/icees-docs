Their focus is on cardiorespiratory conditions, which are prevalent throughout the southern ‘stroke belt’ and represent a major public health challenge. Indeed, in North Carolina, where they both have faculty appointments, stroke, asthma, and a variety of other cardiorespiratory issues are associated with significant healthcare costs, lost workplace productivity, and (for children) excessive school absences.</p>\n<p>JJ and SA learn that <a href=\"/apps/icees\">ICEES</a> contains not only clinical data, but also demographic data and a variety of environmental exposures data, including socio-environmental exposures data derived from the US Census Bureau American Community Survey. To begin exploring the use of ICEES in the context of disparities in health outcomes, they submit several queries to ICEES that ask, in a general sense: what is the relationship between race, exposure to airborne particulate matter of size ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5), and respiratory complications among patients with ‘asthma-like’ conditions? </p>\n<p>The results showed that among African Americans with asthma-like conditions, the proportion of patients with two or more annual emergency department (ED) or inpatient visits for respiratory issues was higher among those exposed to relatively high average daily levels of PM2.5 than among those exposed to relatively low average daily levels of PM2.5 (21.10% versus 8.90%, P &#x3C; 0.0001, N = 6,379). Caucasian patients with asthma-like conditions showed a similar relationship, with a greater proportion of patients with two or more annual ED or inpatient visits for respiratory issues among those exposed to relatively high average daily levels of PM2.5 than among those exposed to relatively low average daily levels of PM2.5 (15.70% versus 7.84%, P &#x3C; 0.0001, N = 13,176).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 58.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"RacalDisparitiesPM2.5Asthma\"\n        title=\"RacalDisparitiesPM2.5Asthma\"\n        src=\"/static/57419f32c6a14659fccbe3dbae244e2b/5a190/RacialDisparitiesPM2.5Asthma.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/57419f32c6a14659fccbe3dbae244e2b/772e8/RacialDisparitiesPM2.5Asthma.png 200w,\n/static/57419f32c6a14659fccbe3dbae244e2b/e17e5/RacialDisparitiesPM2.5Asthma.png 400w,\n/static/57419f32c6a14659fccbe3dbae244e2b/5a190/RacialDisparitiesPM2.5Asthma.png 800w,\n/static/57419f32c6a14659fccbe3dbae244e2b/c1b63/RacialDisparitiesPM2.5Asthma.png 1200w,\n/static/57419f32c6a14659fccbe3dbae244e2b/29007/RacialDisparitiesPM2.5Asthma.png 1600w,\n/static/57419f32c6a14659fccbe3dbae244e2b/0dfb2/RacialDisparitiesPM2.5Asthma.png 6393w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span><a href=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>These findings replicate published literature on the association between airborne pollutant exposure and asthma exacerbations (e.g., Mirabelli et al. 2016).
