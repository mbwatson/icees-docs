A subset of his patients has severe asthma, with symptoms that do not respond to standard treatment. He has observed that many of these patients are female and also suffer from obesity and diabetes. Some of the patients appear to live in heavily populated areas and thus may be exposed to high levels of airborne pollutants. DP would like to formally explore the role of sex, obesity, diabetes, and airborne pollutant exposure in severe asthma. Specifically, he’d like to obtain empirical data on his clinical observations and generate sufficient preliminary data to submit an NIH grant proposal to support deeper exploration of preliminary findings. Thus, DP seeks observational clinical data that meet several criteria:</p>\n<p>(1) the data must be openly accessible and readily available for exploratory research;</p>\n<p>(2) the data must include a broad set of patient characteristics or phenotypes; and </p>\n<p>(3) the data must offer a sufficiently large sample size to provide enough statistical power to draw meaningful conclusions.</p>\n<p>DP learns that <a href=\"/apps/icees\">ICEES</a> may fulfill the above requirements. He submits several ICEES queries, designed as 2 x 2 association tests, that asked: is there an association between exposure to high levels of PM2.5 (binned as (47.06, 114.94) vs (6.77, 47.06) µg/m3 average maximum daily exposure) and diabetes (diagnosis = yes vs no), obesity (diagnosis = yes vs no), or sex (male vs female) among patients with severe asthma (defined by prednisone treatment; N = 2,240)? The results showed that diabetes was more common among patients exposed to relatively high levels of PM2.5 than among patients exposed to relatively low levels of PM2.5 (26.21% vs 19.59%, P = 0.0002). Likewise, obesity was more common among patients exposed to relatively high levels of PM2.5 than among patients exposed to relatively low levels of PM2.5 (17.83% vs 13.62%, P &#x3C; 0.01). No relationship was identified between sex and exposure to PM2.5.</p>\n<p>Thus, DP was able to use ICEES to confirm and extend suspected interactions between exposure to airborne particulates and metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes (e.g., Eze et al. 2015).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c0755287373cceb284d025f1bfbb2a1a/6edca/PM2.5_diabetes_obesity.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 32.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"PM2.5_diabetes_obesity\"\n        title=\"PM2.5_diabetes_obesity\"\n        src=\"/static/c0755287373cceb284d025f1bfbb2a1a/5a190/PM2.5_diabetes_obesity.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c0755287373cceb284d025f1bfbb2a1a/772e8/PM2.5_diabetes_obesity.png 200w,\n/static/c0755287373cceb284d025f1bfbb2a1a/e17e5/PM2.5_diabetes_obesity.png 400w,\n/static/c0755287373cceb284d025f1bfbb2a1a/5a190/PM2.5_diabetes_obesity.png 800w,\n/static/c0755287373cceb284d025f1bfbb2a1a/c1b63/PM2.5_diabetes_obesity.png 1200w,\n/static/c0755287373cceb284d025f1bfbb2a1a/6edca/PM2.5_diabetes_obesity.png 1351w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Of note, this entire research study was conceptualized and executed during a <strong>five-day hackathon</strong>.
